Hi! I am `Chen Chu` (初晨), I am a first-year Computer Science Ph.D. student at the University of Southern California(USC), advised by Professor [Cyrus Shahabi](https://infolab.usc.edu/). I am passionate about developing SOTA AI models to solve spatial problems, which involved trajectory modeling and prediction, spatial representation learning.

Standing at the frontier that bridges spatial data science and Artificial Intelligence, I believe the next turning point of spatial AI will be brought by a unified representation learning method of space and spatial entities.

Prior to my Ph.D., I earned my Master degree from State Key Laboratory of Resources and Environmental Information System(LREIS), University of Chinese Academy of Sciences(UCAS), where I was supervised by Professor [Feng Lu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oeS87xoAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and Associate Professor [Hengcai Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ys6nhTMAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). 

My research interests include **Human Mobility Modeling**, **Spatially Representation Learning**.
